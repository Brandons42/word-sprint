					<h1>How to Play</h1>
					<p>
						All of the game modes are based around linking one word to another.
						These "links" are accomplished by inputting a word that is a
						synonym, antonym, anagram, or rhyme of the target word.
					</p>
					<h2>Endless Mode</h2>
					<p>
						Endless Mode is a game of longevity in which the user attempts to
						stay alive for as long as they can. A user is given a starting word,
						and they input a link to the starting word, then they input a link
						to the word they input before, and so on. Users only have a certain
						amount of time to complete each link. As users complete more and
						more links, they progress to higher levels, meaning they have even
						less time to complete each link. Inevitably, the user will
						eventually run short of links to make and time will expire. When
						this happens, the links the user has made throughout the game are
						shown; however, a back-stabbing list of words the user could've
						input to continue the game is also shown. Endless Mode is the game
						mode displayed in the screen recording.
					</p>
					<h2>Word to Word (W2W)</h2>
					<p>
						W2W Mode is a grueling journey from one word to another. The game
						starts out just like Endless Mode; however, the user has more time
						and is completing links with the end goal of obtaining a final word
						that the user is given at the beginning of the game. The user ends
						the game by either completing a chain of words from the starting
						word to the finishing word, or running out of time and ending up
						with the same fate as the end of an Endless Mode game.
					</p>
					<h2>Sprint Mode</h2>
					<p>
						Sprint Mode is a timed sprint in which the user must frantically
						type as many links as they can. Instead of users entering a
						continous chain of links from word to word as in the other two game
						modes, users complete as many links as they can to the starting word
						only.
