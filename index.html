					<h1>What it is</h1>
					<p>
						Word Sprint is a vibrant, fast-paced word game with three fun game
						modes. Each of the game modes are based around linking one word to
						another. These "links" are accomplished by inputting a word that is
						a synonym/related word, antonym, anagram, or rhyme of the target
						word.
					</p>
					<h1>Game Modes</h1>
					<h2>Thesaurus Mode</h2>
					<button class="see-video" id="0"><p>See video</p></button>
					<p>
						In Thesaurus Mode, you are assigned a random target word, and in the
						time allotted, you must type a word thatâ€™s a synonym, related word,
						antonym, or anagram (doesn't need to use all letters) of the target
						word. After you successfully enter a word, the word you just entered
						becomes the target word, and you must enter a synonym, antonym, or
						anagram of this new target word. You must create the longest chain
						of words that you can.
					</p>
					<h2>Rhyme Mode</h2>
					<button class="see-video" id="1"><p>See video</p></button>
					<p>
						Rhyme Mode is very similar to Thesaurus Mode, with the difference
						being that you must enter a rhyme or anagram (doesn't need to use
						all letters) of the target word.
					</p>
					<h2>Sprint Mode</h2>
					<button class="see-video" id="2"><p>See video</p></button>
					<p>
						In Sprint Mode, you are assigned a random target word, and you must
						type as many words as possible that are a synonym, related word,
						antonym, rhyme, or anagram (doesn't need to use all letters) of the
						target word before the timer runs out.
					</p>
